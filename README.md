#  Html 'Hello world'!
## 1. Why I started learning Html and Css
### first, i want to be front enginnering. As you know, these are necessary things for front enginners so i decide to study alone using online referencess before going to the academy. When it becomes clear that what i want to do a specific role or a project, i'm going to register there.
### second, i need and want to earn money until i get a job. so i will make a resume using html and css as mini portfolio for a part time job . I hope to achieve these goals:)
