#  Html 'Hello world'!
## 1. Why start to learn a Html and Css
### first, i want to be front enginnering. As you know, these are required of front enginners so i decide to study alone using online references before going to private institute. When i assure that what i want to do a specific roll or a project, i'm going to enroll there.
### second, until i get a job i need and want to earn money. so i will make a mini portfolio for a part time job.
